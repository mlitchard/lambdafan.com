# Lambdafan.com

This is the source for my personal website [lambdafan.com](lambdafan.com).
This code is almost entirely from [yesodweb](www.yesodweb.com), and I highly recommend looking at the [yesodweb codebase](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesodweb.com). Just using it to put my own site together taught me some things about 
how you can build a website. One day I may care about css enough to do my own design.
